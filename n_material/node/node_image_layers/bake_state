Baking may produce these weird stripe or wave artifacts, expecially apparent with high contrast
May also shrink
Compositing also shrinks

To test:
- Put .py to all bake_ files, bake_preview already have .py
- Remove .py of image_layers_ui
- In image_layers_prop.ImageLayers_Panel, uncomment bake_settings
- In image_layers_op, change all image_layers_ui to bake_image_layers_ui
